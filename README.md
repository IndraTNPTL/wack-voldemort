# wack-voldemort

by: Indra Tinot-Patole

# Getting started

To get started with the game:

-   URL game: https://indratnptl.github.io/wack-voldemort/

# Game description

This is my first project for IronHack bootcamp, made with HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT.

Globally a Hufflepuff dedicated Wack-the-Mole game with Voldemort and Dobby!

# What is the goal?

As a proud and loyal Hogward student / Hufflepuff, take revenge for Cedric Diggory's death during the Goblet of Fire competition and wack Voldemort!

But be careful, Dobby (as usual) is hanging around places that he is not supposed to and could be hit by your spells.

Everytime you hit Voldemort, you gain 1 point.
But if Dobby is hits, you'll loose 2 points.

Try to reach 65 points in order to win against The Dark Lord Who-Must-Not-Be-Named and avenge Cedric and the Hufflepuff house.

# Why?

I wanted to make a fun and simple game around the Hufflepuff house universe.
This house is always forgotten, even if (let's be honest!) it is the best house of Hogward!
